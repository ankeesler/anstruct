This is a repository of data structure implementations.

All of the code in this repository roughly follows an object model.
Each data structure* has an implementation** and a language***. There
will then be statistics taken on each of the data structures****.

* The data structures planned for this repository are:
List           (list)
Stack          (stack)
Queue          (queue)
Dequeue        (dequeue)
Map            (map)
Set            (set)
Graph          (graph)

** The implementation planned for this repository are as follows.
Array List     (array)
Linked List    (linked)
Adjacency List (adjacencylist)
2D Array       (2darray)

*** Currently, the planned language support is for C and C++.

*** Here are some statistics that could be taken on these data structures.
